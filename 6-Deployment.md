Here’s a summarized guide on **Deploying New Image Tags to ECS Automatically** using GitHub Actions:

# ECS Deployment with New Image Tags

This guide walks through setting up an automated deployment process that triggers a new deployment to ECS whenever a new commit with updated tags is pushed to your repository.

---

## 1. Update Task Definition with New Image Tag

When a developer makes a commit and tags a new version, we want the updated image to be deployed to the ECS cluster. We'll create a new job in the GitHub Actions workflow to deploy the new image tag.

### Steps:

### Step 1: Copy the ECS Task Definition JSON
1. Go to your ECS task definition and copy the JSON.
2. Paste it into the root of your cloned repository.

### Step 2: Define Environmental Variables for Deployment
We’ll define the necessary environment variables, such as cluster, service, and repository information.

### Step 3: Use ECS Render Task Definition Action
We use the **`amazon-ecs-render-task-definition`** action to update the task definition with the new image tag.

```yaml
- name: Fill in the new image ID in the Amazon ECS task definition
  id: task-def
  uses: aws-actions/amazon-ecs-render-task-definition@v1
  with:
    task-definition: task-definition.json
    container-name: my-container
    image: ${{ steps.build-image.outputs.image }}
```

This step updates the `task-definition.json` file with the new image tag.

### Step 4: Deploy the New Task Definition to ECS
The next step deploys the updated task definition to ECS.

```yaml
- name: Deploy Amazon ECS task definition
  uses: aws-actions/amazon-ecs-deploy-task-definition@v2
  with:
    task-definition: ${{ steps.task-def.outputs.task-definition }}
    service: my-service
    cluster: my-cluster
    wait-for-service-stability: true
```

This step deploys the updated task definition to your ECS cluster and waits for the service to stabilize.

## 2. Automatic Workflow Trigger

To ensure that the workflow is automatically triggered whenever a new commit is pushed, add the following at the top of the workflow:

```yaml
on: [push, workflow_dispatch]
```

This configuration will trigger the workflow on every push and allow manual triggers via GitHub Actions UI.

## 3. Full Workflow Steps

Here is the flow of the entire setup:

### Step 1: GitHub Actions Setup
- Clone the repository.
- Log in to AWS using access keys.
- Update the ECS task definition file with the new image tag.

### Step 2: Deploy Updated Image
- Use the updated task definition to deploy the image to ECS.

### Step 3: Monitor the Deployment
- After the deployment, verify the updated task definition in ECR.
- Confirm the ECS cluster is running with the new image tag.

---

## 4. Conclusion

- **GitHub Setup**: We defined a workflow to automatically deploy Docker images to ECS when a new tag is pushed.
- **Testing Setup**: We added testing using Maven, Checkstyle, and SonarCloud.
- **AWS Services**: We set up ECR, IAM roles, RDS, ECS cluster, task definitions, and services.
- **Deployment**: The job builds the Docker image, uploads it to ECR, and deploys it to ECS using the task definition.

---

Now, you have a fully automated process for deploying updated Docker images to ECS whenever new changes are pushed to your repository.
```

### Key Highlights:
- **Task Definition**: Use GitHub Actions to automatically update the task definition with the new image tag.
- **Deployment Process**: Deploy the new image to ECS and ensure stability using the ECS deploy action.
- **Automatic Trigger**: The workflow runs automatically when a commit is made, ensuring continuous deployment.
